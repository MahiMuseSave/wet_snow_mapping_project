# Wet Snow Mapping Project

This repository contains the source code and radar image assets for classifying wet and dry snow using neural networks and SAR imagery.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Snow_mapping_neural.mlx` — MATLAB Live Script implementing neural network classification.
- `radar-images/` — Folder containing SAR `.tiff` images from 2011–2016.
- `All_in_one/` — Central directory where all content and scripts are stored.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Open `Snow_mapping_neural.mlx` in MATLAB.
2. Make sure the `radar-images` directory is extracted and accessible.
3. Run the script. The output includes snow classification maps and plots.
